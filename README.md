# Polished: [Deployed Site](https://polishedapp.herokuapp.com/)


## Project Summary
Polished is a nail polish swatch and review site where users can view other people’s swatches and reviews of different polishes, as well as leave their own swatches and reviews. They can also save polishes to their list of favorites.

For people who like doing their nails or having them done, finding new polishes can be really fun and exciting, but it’s often hard to know what those polishes will really look like out of the bottle. There are a number of polish bloggers/Instagrammers/YouTubers who share swatches of polishes and share their reviews, but there's no way of keeping track of the polishes you’ve liked and might want to buy - you'd have to create your own document or spreadsheet. 

Polished creates a space where anyone can share their images of their nails so that others can see what those colors look like on real people. And if you see a polish that you like, you can save it to your list of favorites so that you can come back to it later.

## Usolved Problems:
- "Save to Favorites" still appears on polishes even if you've already saved them to your favorites; clicking it removes the polish from your liset.
- I'd like to streamline the review creation process so that you can upload a swatch at the same time as you create your review.

<br>

## Future Features:
- Ability for the user to add polishes.
- Tags for reviews so that they are more searchable.
- Storefront so that users can purhase the polishes they like.
